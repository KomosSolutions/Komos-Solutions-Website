                        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
                        <p>Like most websites, our Websites use cookies and similar technology.  Cookies are small text files that are sent to your computer when you use a website.  A cookie only tracks which computer is logging on to the Websites and tracks
                            the actions and the pages visited on our Websites, it does not necessarily identify who is using that computer.</p>
                        <p>If you continue to use the Websites without consenting to the use of cookies or otherwise having declined their use, we will not send any cookies to your computer.  In this case or if you disable or delete cookies through your browser,
                            you will not be able to use all the functionality of the Websites.</p>
                        <p>The Websites use both persistent and session cookies.  Persistent cookies are cookies that stay on your computer permanently until you 'manually' delete them.  Session cookies delete themselves automatically when you leave the Website
                            and go to another one or shut down your browser.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>How Will We Use The Information About You?</h2>
                        <p>We collect the information about you to process your order, manage your account, and if you agree, to email you about other products and services.</p>
                        <p>We collect usage information about you when you use the Service.  We will not share your information with any third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
                        <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Komos Solutions, its customers,
                            or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.  We may also disclose your personal information to any person, firm or company
                            who acquires or proposes to acquire any relevant part of our business to which your information relates or in respect of which it is used.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Websites; any

                        <p>Our Websites are a publishing medium in that anyone may register and then publish information about himself or some other person.  We do not moderate or control what is posted.  If you complain about any of the content on our Websites,

                            or that of the person who posted the content which offends you.  If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.</p>

                        <p>If you provide information to us with a view to it being read, copied, downloaded or used by other people, we accept no responsibility for what that third party may do with it and you acknowledge that you have no control whatever
                            as to how it may be used.</p>
